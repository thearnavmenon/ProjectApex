## 2026-06-07 — Stopped bad workout "pattern" labels from sneaking in

**The problem (in plain words):**
When the app sends a workout to the server, each set can carry a "pattern" label —
like "horizontal_push" for a bench press. The server keeps a fixed list of valid
pattern names. But the old code trusted whatever the app sent, even made-up words.
Those junk words got dropped into the "what you trained today" list. That list helps
the app decide when to quietly clear an old injury or form note — so a junk label
could trip that safety check by accident.

**What I changed:**
The server now only accepts a pattern if it's on the real list of valid names. If the
app sends junk, the server ignores it and works out the correct pattern from the
exercise name instead. So bad data can't sneak in, and it also can't hide the right
answer.

**How I made sure it works:**
I wrote three tests first. Two of them failed before the fix (which proved the bug was
real), then passed after. All the important tests pass (91 out of 91).

**Status:** Done and merged. Filed as issue #239, fixed in pull request #240, now merged into the main branch — issue #239 is closed.

*(This is also the day the diary started.)*
